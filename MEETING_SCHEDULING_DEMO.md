# Meeting Scheduling Feature Demo

## Overview

The AI Meeting Scheduler now supports automatic meeting scheduling with date parsing and email confirmations!

- **Admin notification**: Sent to your admin email
- **AI-generated personalized content** with dynamic subject lines
- **Beautiful HTML emails** with gradients and modern design

### 3. Meeting Management

- **View meetings**: `/meetings` command to see all scheduled meetings
- **Meeting status tracking**: pending, confirmed, cancelled
- **Unique meeting IDs** for easy reference
