# Meeting Schedule AI Bot - Twilio Integration Demo

## How It Works

Your Telegram bot now automatically calls users when it receives a phone number in a meeting request.

### Example Flow:

1. **User sends message to bot:**

   ```

   ```

2. **Bot processes the request:**

   - ✅ Validates phone number format
   - ✅ Extracts contact details (name, reason)
   - ✅ Sends confirmation message
   - 📞 **Automatically initiates Twilio call**

3. **Recipient receives call:**

   - Phone rings at +1234567890
   - Automated message plays:
     > "Hello John Doe! This is an automated call from Meeting Schedule AI. [Requester Name] has requested to schedule a meeting with you for project discussion. Please confirm your availability. Thank you!"

4. **Bot provides updates:**

   ```
   🎉 Call initiated successfully!

   📞 Calling John Doe at +1234567890
   🆔 Call ID: CA123abc456def
   📊 Status: queued

   The recipient will receive an automated call with meeting details.
   ```

5. **Call status tracking:**
